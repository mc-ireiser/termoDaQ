# termoDaQ

termoDaQ is a development board based on the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) architecture, uses an [ATmega328-P](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-42735-8-bit-AVR-Microcontroller-ATmega328-328P_Summary.pdf) and an [ATtiny85](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-2586-AVR-8-bit-Microcontroller-ATtiny25-ATtiny45-ATtiny85_Datasheet-Summary.pdf) for its operation, this board was originally designed to help the work of oceanography students, by serving as an instrument for the acquisition of physical variables (temperature, pressure) at surface level in bodies of fresh or salt water, in order to detect changes that may affect the flora or fauna of ecosystems, automating the work of making measurements over time.

- But it can serve many purposes, since it has connection for GPS receiver, pressure sensor, multiple temperature sensors and SD card.

The function of the [ATtiny85](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-2586-AVR-8-bit-Microcontroller-ATtiny25-ATtiny45-ATtiny85_Datasheet-Summary.pdf) is a timer server for programming through a potentiometer the operation cycles of the equipment, reducing the energy consumption.
