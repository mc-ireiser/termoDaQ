# Attention

Currently the firmware used by the board is to be developed, at the beginning of the process the source code will be shared in this repository.

- The estimated date for the start of code development is **December 15, 2017**.

but do not worry, tests have already been performed on each of the sensors involved and they work correctly as expected. [Picture]()

Meanwhile you can perform tests or create your own code based on the [**arduino**](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/) architecture.

See you soon in this space!
